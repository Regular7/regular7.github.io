                    <h3>an example</h3>
                    <img src="img/regular7-example.png" width="640px"/>
                    <p>In the example above, we see a Regular7 header file. Header files are a type of a Regular7 block marking a directory and it's subdirectories as a Regular7 interpretable repository.</p>
                    <p>Everytime when you start a new R7 project, or would like to share your work based on some other technology, you will need to write such a header file. Do not worry, the R7 interpreter will help you out fill most of this stuff interactively.</p>
                    <p>Specifically, the code above displays some of the interesting features of the language:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Procedures</b> - the first entry in the header block is a description of a Regular7 procedure call. Here the procedure <i>system.get</i> is invoked with implicit argument <i>(date)</i> taken from the name of the datapoint.</p>
                            <p>Contrast this with the third entry, where the parameter to <i>system.get</i> was passed explicitly as <i>(machine-name)</i> and bound to <i>nom</i>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Data transfer operators</b> - also in the first entry, we can see the funny <i><=</i> operator. This guy tells the interpreter to recompute the data, in contrast to the <i>=</i> transport operator, which will take the right hand expression, compute it, and store it in the R7 repository.</p>
                            <p>By choosing carefully between these two operators, you can share your work with other people and their machines, sending them expensive to compute data along with the instructions to compute it, if need be.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>in development</h3>
                    <p>This is a very young project, seeking contributors interested in helping people use computers and share their work with other people. We have many features planned and under cosideration, here are some of them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Hosted interpreter model for embedding (a) R7 conforming interpreter into your app
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you don't want to embed an interpreter, we also plan to provide a web API for commanding an interpreter 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Inference engine for interactive exploration of R7 repositories 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <i>human</i> procedure standard library, for teaching computers about humans and their domain
                        </li>
                    </ul>
